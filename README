Overview
    In this assignment, you will implement a command line interpreter or shell. The shell should operate in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished.

    The shell you implement will be similar to, but much simpler than, the one you run every day in Unix. You can find out which shell you are running by typing "echo $SHELL" at a prompt. You may then wish to look at the man pages for 'sh' or the shell you are running (more likely tcsh or bash) to learn more about all of the functionality that a shell can support. For this project, you do not need to implement much functionality.
